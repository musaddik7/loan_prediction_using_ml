# 🏦 Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is a machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on customer details like income, education, and credit history.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Predict loan approval based on customer attributes using classification algorithms.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes features like:
- Gender, Married
- ApplicantIncome, Credit_History
- Education, Self_Employed
- LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term

Target variable: `Loan_Status`

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
